# MLOps hands-on lab step-by-step 

## Abstract and learning objectives 

In this hands-on lab, you will learn how Trey Research can leverage Deep Learning technologies to scan through their vehicle specification documents to find compliance issues with new regulations. You will standardize the model format to ONNX and observe how this simplifies inference runtime code, enabling pluggability of different models and targeting a broad range of runtime environments and most importantly, improves inferencing speed over the native model. You will build a DevOps pipeline to coordinate retrieving the latest best model from the model registry, packaging the web application, deploying the web application and inferencing web service. After a first successful deployment, you will make updates to both the model, the and web application, and execute the pipeline once to achieve an updated deployment. You will also learn how to monitor the model's performance after it is deployed so Trey Research can be proactive with performance issues.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to implement end-to-end solutions that fully operationalize deep learning models, inclusive of all application components that depend on the model.

## Overview

Trey Research Inc. delivers innovative solutions for manufacturers. They specialize in identifying and solving problems for manufacturers that can run the range from automating away mundane but time-intensive processes, to delivering cutting edge approaches that provide new opportunities for their manufacturing clients. Trey Research has decades specializing in data science and application development that until now were separate units. They have seen the value created by the ad-hoc synergies between data science and app development, but they would like to unlock the greater, long term value as they formalize their approach by combining the two units into one, and follow one standardized process for operationalizing their innovations.

As their first effort of this combined initiative, they would like to define a process for operationalizing deep learning that encompasses all phases of the application life cycle along with model creation and deployment of a deep learning model. For this first proof of concept (PoC), they would like to focus on component compliance. Specifically, they are looking to leverage Deep Learning technologies with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to scan through vehicle specification documents to find compliance issues with new regulations. Even though this first scenario is focused on vehicle components, they believe this approach will generalize to any scenario involving an inventory of components, which all of their manufacturing customers deal with. The component descriptions, which are free form text, are entered and managed via a web application. This web application take new component descriptions entered by authorized technicians and label the component as compliant or non-compliant, based on the text.

They want to ensure the overall process they create enables them to update both the underlying model and the web app in one, unified pipeline. They also want to be able to monitor the model's performance after it is deployed so they can be proactive with performance issues.

## Solution architecture

![The lab solution architecture as described by the text that follows.](media/architecture-overview.png, 'Solution Architecture')

The overall approach used in this lab is to orchestrate continuous integration and continuous delivery Azure Pipelines from Azure DevOps. These pipelines are triggered by changes to artifacts that describe a machine learning pipeline, that is created with the Azure Machine Learning SDK. In the lab, you make a change to the model training script that executes the Azure Pipelines Build Pipeline, which trains the model and creates the container image. Then this triggers an Azure Pipelines Release pipeline that deploys the model as a web service to AKS, by using the Docker image that was created in the Build pipeline. Once in production, the scoring web service is monitored using a combination of Application Insights and Azure Storage.

## Requirements

1.  Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.

    - Trial subscriptions will not work. You will run into issues with Azure resource quota limits.

    - Subscriptions with access limited to a single resource group will not work. You will need the ability to deploy multiple resource groups.

2. An Azure DevOps account.

## Before the hands-on lab

Refer to the Before the hands-on lab setup guide manual before continuing to the lab exercises.

## Exercise 1: Creating and evaluating compliance classification models

Duration: 40 minutes

In this exercise, you create a model for classifying component text as compliant or non-compliant.

### Task 1: Create the classification model using a notebook

1. Browse to your Azure Notebooks project and navigate to `Deep Learning with Text.ipynb`. This is the notebook you will step through executing in this lab.

2. Follow the instructions within the notebook to complete the lab.

3. In Azure Notebooks navigate to the `models` folder and download the **model.h5** file to your local disk. We will use the downloaded model file in the next exercise. *Note that if the downloaded file name is changed to `utf-8''model.h5`, then rename the file back to `model.h5`*.

    >**Note**: The **model.h5** file is generated during the execution of the notebook at the previous step (step 2). When running the notebook, make sure the execution is successful and the file is correctly created.


## Exercise 2: Registering the model

    ![Provide connection name, and Azure Resource Group and then select Ok. The resource group should match the value you provided in the YAML file.](media/09.png 'Add an Azure Resource Manager service connection dialog')


## Exercise 4: Setup and Run the Build Pipeline

Duration: 25 minutes

### Task 1: Setup Build Pipeline

1. From left navigation select **Pipelines, Builds** and then select **New pipeline**.

    ![Navigate to Pipelines, Builds, and then select New pipeline](media/10.png 'New Build Pipeline')
    
2. Select **Azure Repos Git** as your code repository.

    ![Select your code repository source for your new build pipeline.](media/11.png 'Repository Source')

3. Select **mlops-quickstart** as your repository.

    ![Select mlops-quickstart as your repository.](media/12.png 'Select Repository')

4. Review the YAML file.

    The build pipeline has four key steps:
    
    a. Attach folder to workspace and experiment. This command creates the `.azureml` subdirectory that contains a `config.json` file that is used to communicate with your Azure Machine Learning workspace. All subsequent steps rely on the `config.json` file to instantiate the workspace object.
    
    b. Create the AML Compute target to run your master pipeline for model training and model evaluation.
    
    c. Run the master pipeline. The master pipeline has two steps: (1) Train the machine learning model, and (2) Evaluate the trained machine learning model. The evaluation step evaluates if the new model performance is better than the currently deployed model. If the new model performance is improved, the evaluate step will create a new Image for deployment. The results of the evaluation step will be saved in a file called `eval_info.json` that will be made available for the release pipeline. You can review the code for the master pipeline and its steps in `aml_service/pipelines_master.py`,  `scripts/train.py`, and `scripts/evaluate.py`.
    
    d. Publish the build artifacts. The `snapshot of the repository`, `config.json`, and `eval_info.json` files are published as build artifacts and thus can be made available for the release pipeline.

    ![Review the build pipeline YAML file.](media/13.png 'Build pipeline YAML')

### Task 2: Run the Build Pipeline

1. Select **Run** to start running your build pipeline.

    ![Start the run for your build pipeline.](media/14.png 'Run Build Pipeline')

2. Monitor the build run. The build pipeline, for the first run, will take around 15-20 minutes to run.

    ![Monitor your build pipeline. It will take around 15 to 20 minutes to run.](media/15.png 'Monitor Build Pipeline')

### Task 3: Review Build Artifacts

1. The build will publish an artifact named `devops-for-ai`. Select **Artifacts, devops-for-ai** to review the artifact contents.

    ![Select Artifacts, devops-for-ai to review the artifact contents.](media/16.png 'Build Artifacts')

2. Select **outputs, eval_info.json** and then select **Download**. The `eval_info.json` is the output from the *model evaluation* step and the information from the evaluation step will be later used in the release pipeline to deploy the model. Select **Close** to close the dialog.

    ![Download output from the model evaluation step.](media/17.png 'Download JSON file')

3. Open the `eval_info.json` in a json viewer or a text editor and observe the information. The json output contains information such as if the model passed the evaluation step (`deploy_model`: *true or false*), and the name and id of the created image (`image_name` and `image_id`) to deploy.

    ![Review information in the eval_info json file.](media/18.png 'Eval Info JSON File')

### Task 4: Review Build Outputs

1. Log in to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com). Open your **Resource Group, Workspace, Models** section, and observe the registered model: `compliance-classifier`.

    ![Review registered model in Azure Portal.](media/53.png 'Registered Models in Azure Portal')

2. Open your **Resource Group, Workspace, Images** section and observe the deployment image created during the build pipeline: `compliance-classifier-image`.

In this exercise you learn how to monitor the performance of a deployed model.

### Task 1: Activate App Insights and data collection on the deployed model

1. Browse to your Azure Notebooks project and navigate to the [Model Telemetry](notebooks/Model%20Telemetry.ipynb) notebook. This is the notebook you will step through executing in this task.

2. Follow the instructions within the notebook to complete the task. When finished, your deployed model has now both [Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) integration and data collection activated.

### Task 2: Check Application Insights telemetry

1. Navigate to the Azure Portal and locate the resource group you created for this lab (the one where the Azure Machine Learning service workspace was created in).

2. Locate the Application Insights instance in the resource group and click on it.

3. Go to **Overview**.

4. From the top row of the right section select **Logs (Analytics)**. This will open the Application Insights query editor with an empty new query.

    ![From Application Insights Dashboard, select Logs to open the Query Editor.](media/telemetry-02.png 'Application Insights - Dashboard')

5. In the left pane, make sure the **Schema** tab is selected. 

6. Hover over **requests** and click the icon on the right side - "Show sample records from this table".

7. Look at the results displayed. Application Insights is tracing all requests made to your model. Sometimes, a couple of minutes are needed for the telemetry information to propagate. If there are no results displayed, wait a minute, call again your model, and click **Run** to re-execute the Application Insights query.

### Task 3: Check the data collected

1. Navigate to the Azure Portal and locate the resource group you created for this lab (the one where the Azure Machine Learning service workspace was created in).
2. Locate the Storage Account instance in the resource group and click on it.

    ![From the Resource Group Overview locate the Telemetry Storage account](media/telemetry-05.png 'Resource Group Overview')

3. Go to **Storage Explorer (preview)**.

4. Expand the **BLOB CONTAINERS** section and identify the **modeldata** container. Select **More->Refresh** if you do not see **modeldata** container.

5. Identify the CSV files containing the collected data. The path to the output blobs is based on the following structure:

    `modeldata -> subscriptionid -> resourcegroup -> workspace -> webservice -> model -> version -> identifier -> year -> month -> day -> data.csv`

## After the hands-on lab 

Duration: 5 minutes

To avoid unexpected charges, it is recommended that you clean up all of your lab resources when you complete the lab.

### Task 1: Clean up lab resources

1.  Navigate to the Azure Portal and locate the `MCW-AI-Lab` Resource Group you created for this lab.

2.  Select **Delete resource group** from the command bar.

3.  In the confirmation dialog that appears, enter the name of the resource group and select **Delete**.

4.  Wait for the confirmation that the Resource Group has been successfully deleted. If you don't wait, and the delete fails for some reason, you may be left with resources running that were not expected. You can monitor using the Notifications dialog, which is accessible from the Alarm icon.

    ![The Notifications dialog box has a message stating that the resource group is being deleted.](media/image72.png 'Delete Resource Group Notification Dialog')

5.  When the Notification indicates success, the cleanup is complete.

You should follow all steps provided _after_ attending the Hands-on lab.
